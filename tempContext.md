=>The product data should include features these features include products popularity , its category and other relevant features that can be used to recommend it to someone how has joined your platform for the first time ! Although we can start with these features but these features need to change periodically

## have to fix select_product from bandit.py: when will it start to learn user preference so that it give more weight to categories which user like instead of generating recommendation from each category 

What are the issues in this bandit.py . I have a very less understanding of this file and of ml and python so I have generated this code 
My main purpose was to build a recommendation system which utilizes reinforcement learning because i wanted to give user a tick and cross button so it would work like a feedback for the system. tick means user like this product and product similar to it and just opposite for cross. For simplicity purpose it was recommended to me that I should use MAB algorithm. Now after spending hours of my time I don't see it working what went wrong ? How can I fix it ? Was it a good option from the beginning (given I am preparing this whole thing for my personal project and for an upcoming hackathon)? Is too less data for training is the main culprit here ? Should I have just used some simple pre-trained model for recommendation system and fine-tune it for my use ?
