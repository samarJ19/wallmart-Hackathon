useRecommendation, the useEffect in this need to run whever user clicks on a button referesh or something like that.Also initially products is not an array so we have to put some type of checks before rendering the actaul functions.Like until we get the data we should not get functionality involving array features
->files involves: useRecommendation.ts and Foryou.tsx

Restructure home.tsx, include a side bar which will have two buttons redirecting the user to cart page and Foryou page, both these pages have been completed so you don't need to give code for them just focus on the given file and implement pagination and shimmer based loading skeletons.

=>The product data should include features these features include products popularity , its category and other relevant features that can be used to recommend it to someone how has joined your platform for the first time ! Although we can start with these features but these features need to change periodically
