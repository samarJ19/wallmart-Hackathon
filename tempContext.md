## Question About the Current API Structure

Why is the current version of the API instance **so verbose and overly complex**?

It feels like it could have been simplified into just two core things:

1. An **initializer for an Axios instance**
2. A way to **add a token to every request via an interceptor**

But instead, it includes **multiple methods for specific types of requests**, which I think makes it **very complex and harder to understand**.

> *Note: I'm a beginner, so I'm not sure if this is standard for production-scale code. Can you explain how this structure helps?*

## Current Structure Overview

Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:

* `API.ts`:

  * Provides a **custom hook**
  * Attaches the **token to each request**
  * Exposes **multiple methods** that abstract the info required by routes

* A **Singleton instance** of API

* API itself is essentially an **Axios instance**

## My Confusion

I’m trying to debug an issue in my app but I’m stuck due to not fully understanding this API abstraction.

### Problem in `AuthContext`:

When a user **does not exist on the backend**, it should call the `/api/users/sync` route. That route returns the following JSON:

```ts
res.json({ 
  success: true, 
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    clerkId: user.clerkId,
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name,
    avatar: user.avatar
  }
});
```

### Call in Code:

```ts
const createdUser = await api.post('/api/users/sync');
```

Although I’ve updated the URL, I **don’t understand what I will get back in return** because the abstraction makes it hard to trace what `api.post()` is actually doing or returning.

## Help Me Understand

Without a proper understanding of how the API abstraction is built and structured, I can't effectively debug or maintain this codebase.

* Why is it done this way?
* How does this structure benefit production applications?
* Is this a common pattern?
